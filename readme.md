# P28
This is just a project I challenged myself to. Its a Proxy in 28 (active development) hours. (hence the name P28). \
The amount of hours was chosen using a random number generator and has no special meaning :).

# ‚è∞ Log
Hour 0 is everything I did before starting the timer.

| Hour 	| Accomplished 	|
|:---:	|---	|
| 0 	| Writing this readme and doing a bit of research about Minecraft proxies. <br> Made a list of the features I want to add to the project. <br> No code has been written at this point in time. 	|
| 1 	| Managed to get a working proxy with a testing command.<br>It's quite difficult to come up with a good hierarchy of files when the clock is ticking.<br>Quite happy with how much I accomplished in one hour though, even if I had some knowledge about proxies beforehand. 	|
| 2 	| Added a logging class with log files (quite happy with this).<br>Also updated the test command to include some more info for actual testing and fixed some bugs here and there. 	|
| 3 	| Added a chat reporting shortcut. The localhost server now also shows the Hypixel MOTD and player counts.<br>Can't get ping to work though. As usual also some general bug fixes. 	|
| 4 & 5 	| Spent a lot of time investigating packets and trying things.<br>Added modules :D. Made a test module and an ez bypass module (just had to). <br>Also spent a long time debugging modules and lost an easy 50 minutes on that :/ 	|
